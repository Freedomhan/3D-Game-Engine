# 3D-Game
This is a C++ based 3D game. Currently the idea and gamplay of this project is yet to be decided - but some basic features have already been implemented including:

> Input managment - Mouse and keyboard including modifiers and all key states

> Sound managment - 3D and 2D audio. Including audio listeners, SFX and music

> Simple graphics - Drawing an array of vericies

> Shaders - Support for any type of GLSL shader

To do this the following dependencies are used:
GLFW - For creating the window and gandeling S speic operations
GLEW - The extension rangler for OPEN GL
OpenGL - Allows for drawwing of graphics via the GPU
OpenAL - For 3D audio managment
libogg - Upacking .ogg file
libvorbis - Decoder of .ogg files
